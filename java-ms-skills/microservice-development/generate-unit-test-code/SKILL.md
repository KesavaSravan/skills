description: Use when generating or updating focused Java unit tests for newly changed business behavior in a Spring Boot backend API microservices or adapter libraries. Triggers include unit test generation, JUnit 5, Mockito, StepVerifier, controller tests, service tests, adapter client tests, or coverage-focused test design for changed code.

# Unit Testing

Generate focused Java tests for newly changed behavior only. Use the repository and code-generation handoff already present in context; do not broaden scope into unrelated production code. Test execution and stabilization belong to `execute-unit-tests`.

## Expected Test Structure

Mirror the production package under `src/test/java`.

Domain service shape:

```text
src/test/java/<root-package>/<service>/
  controller/       controller endpoint and validation tests
  service/          service and ServiceImpl tests
  config/           validator/security/Jackson/downstream handler tests when changed
  exception/        global handler and custom exception tests when changed
  karate/           API/integration entry points such as *KarateIT
src/test/resources/
  application-test.yaml
  feature/          Karate feature files
```

Adapter library shape:

```text
src/test/java/<root-package>/<adapter>/
  client/           port-level tests when present
  client/impl/      adapter implementation tests
  config/           properties, auto-config, circuit breaker tests when changed
  context/          RequestContext tests
  dto/              serialization/deserialization tests when behavior changed
  helper/           header/helper tests when changed
  service/          token/cache/mapping service tests
  service/impl/     implementation tests
src/test/resources/
  application-test.yml
```

Common naming:

- Unit test classes end with `Test`.
- Integration tests end with `IT` or `IntegrationTest`.
- Karate tests may end with `KarateTest` or `KarateIT`.

## Scope Rules

- Modify test code only.
- Create tests only for newly changed business behavior.
- Prefer one focused test class per changed production class.
- Create no more than 3 test classes.
- Cover success, validation, and error propagation for changed service/controller/client behavior.
- Skip passive DTO getters/setters, configuration property binding, auto-configuration, and duplicate error-only test classes unless the changed production behavior specifically requires them.
- Target at least 80% coverage of changed business logic without expanding scope.

## Framework Conventions

- Use JUnit 5.
- Use Mockito for isolated service/client tests.
- Use existing Spring test support for controller/context tests.
- Use `reactor-test` `StepVerifier` for `Mono`/`Flux` behavior.
- Use Arrange-Act-Assert structure.
- Keep assertions behavior-focused, not implementation-detail-focused.
- Reuse existing test fixtures, builders, constants, object mappers, and security setup from nearby tests.

## Domain Service Test Targets

Controller tests should cover:

- HTTP method/path/query/header binding for the changed endpoint.
- Required validation failures for changed inputs.
- Delegation to the service.
- Response status/body/header shape that the endpoint owns.
- Error translation only when the controller/global handler behavior changed.

Service tests should cover:

- Adapter/shared-lib client invocation.
- DTO mapping.
- Validation or guard behavior.
- Downstream error propagation or mapping through the existing handler.
- Reactive success/error completion with `StepVerifier`.

## Adapter Library Test Targets

Client implementation tests should cover:

- URI construction.
- Required argument validation.
- Header propagation through `HeaderHelper`, `HeaderObject`, or `RequestContext`.
- Token usage and 401 token invalidation/retry when changed.
- Timeout/error propagation.
- Correct `HttpMethod`, body, and `ParameterizedTypeReference` usage at the transport boundary.

Service/helper tests should cover token caching, mapping, context propagation, and helper logic only when those production classes changed.

## After Creation

Use `execute-unit-tests` to run or stabilize the created/modified tests. Keep any implementation handoff in `code-output-handoff` when that file is required by the workflow.
